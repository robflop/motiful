# Motiful

 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/robflop/motiful.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/robflop/motiful)

A Discord selfbot written using discord.js.

Motiful also uses the snekfetch, chalk and moment packages, plus some standard node modules.

# Important Disclaimer: Use at your own risk

Selfbots along with some features provided by these bot are not allowed by the Discord Terms of Service. Usage of this selfbot is completely on your own liability. I am not responsible for _**anything**_ you do on your own using it.

## Self-hosting usage

(It is assumed you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) on at least version 7.6 as well as [git](https://git-scm.com) installed)

- Rename `config.example.json` in the `src/` folder to `config.json`
- Get your token from within Discord Dev Tools (Opened via CTRL+SHIFT+I/Command+Option+I inside Discord) -> Instructions [here](http://i.imgur.com/OhBVCoA.png)
- Fill out your token in `config.json`
- Adjust other config settings to your liking
- run `npm install` in a command window located in the directory you downloaded motiful in to install necessary packages
- (Feel free to ignore any `unmet peer dependency` or `... requires a peer of...` warnings)
- Navigate into the `src/` folder to set the working directory of motiful correctly
- Start the bot using `node motiful.js` in a command window located in the directory you downloaded motiful in to!

### Adding commands

Adding commands to Motiful is very easy. The command handler will automatically register any .js file within the commands folder so
the only thing you have to do is make your command file, write the code for it(*), and restart the selfbot.

That's all, now your command is available under the name you gave the js file. 
Use it with `<prefix> <command>`. It will also be listed in the `help` command.

(\*) *Commands extend the Command class located in `structures/` and must at least provide the name property in the constructor aswell as a `run()` function outside the constructor or errors will happen. See existing commands for usage examples.*

#### Information

- The default command prefix is `--`.
- Commands are case **insensitive**, emotes are case **sensitive**.
- User config files (favorites, quotes, toggled commands list, custom emote files) are saved in the `data/` file.
