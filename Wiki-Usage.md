# Tags:
Tags in motiful are a feature seperate from commands -- *they **_don't_** use the command prefix, nor do they have a specific "command name" that tells motiful to use them -- all it listens to is the format in which things are written.*

To trigger a tag, just place it in your message alongside your other content enclosed by brackets, e.g. `My name is [name]!`. This will result in motiful trying to find a tag called `name`, replacing the tag call with the output this tag results in.

Assuming you have a tag called `name`, with value `robflop`, the result of the above would be: 

`My name is robflop!`.

If a tag cannot be found (e.g. you do *not* have a tag called `name`), motiful will simply ignore this and leave the text as-is, because you don't always want to use a tag when you use brackets. This is to avoid complications when trying to type text unrelated to the tags system.

In addition to this, it is possible to use on-the-fly evaluation using the `eval` keyword as tag name. To evaluate using this, provide the tag in a fashion such as this:

`My name is [eval: client.user.username]!`.

Motiful will then evaluate the code behind the keyword, resulting in a text of `My name is robflop`, if we assume that your username is `robflop`.

If you write more complex tag functions to for example fetch a guild and get any of its properties, you can pass parameters to your function in the same way as you would pass it to eval, each parameter being comma seperated.

For example let's take the above eval and turn it into a tag with parameter:

Your tag function would look like this: 
```js
name => `My name is ${name}!`
```

and would be used like this: `[name: robflop]`, resulting in the same as the above eval.

**Important notices**:

Only **one** tag is possible per message. This is due to internal workings of scanning the message for tags with complex inputs such as arrays, objects etc.
 
Also, the tags system is generally only meant for simple-ish functions, not a fully flexed eval command or an entire standalone command. Keep this in mind when writing tags.

You will likely encounter errors if you go too deep into nesting aswell.
